# Image-Resizing-Using-Dynamic-Programming-Algorithm


Seam carving, also known as liquid rescaling, is a clever computer algorithm created by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir. It's used for resizing images while keeping the important parts intact. Imagine you have a photo, and you want to make it fit nicely on your phone or a big screen without distorting the main content.

So, what this algorithm does is it finds paths of least importance in the image, called "seams," and either removes them to make the image smaller or adds seams to make it larger. It's like giving the image a kind of flexible makeover.

What's cool is that you can also tell the algorithm to leave certain areas alone, preventing them from being changed. It's handy when you want to keep specific parts of the image just the way they are.

The main goal of seam carving is to solve the problem of displaying images on different-sized devices, like phones or projection screens, without messing up how they look. This is particularly useful for web pages that can adjust text and layout dynamically but struggle with resizing images.

Dynamic programming is a smart way of solving complex problems by breaking them into simpler sub-problems and storing the solutions to avoid redundant work. In the context of image processing, dynamic programming can be used to compute seams. A seam is like a path of least importance in an image that can be removed to resize the image.

Here's a simple explanation of how dynamic programming works for computing seams:

Energy Calculation: Each pixel in a row is assigned an energy value, which represents its importance. The top-left pixel has the energy value in red, and the black values represent the cumulative sum of energies up to that pixel.

Top Row: The top row of pixels has no pixels above them, so their energies are the same as the original image.

Energy Propagation: For each pixel in the rest of the rows, the energy is calculated as its own energy plus the minimum of the three energies above it. This is done row by row until reaching the bottom.

Finding the Optimal Seam: The seam with the lowest energy is identified by working backward from the pixels with the lowest energies, following the path of minimal energy.

It's important to note that the energy calculation can be parallelized for simple functions, and the DP array calculation can also be parallelized with some communication between processes. However, dealing with the challenge of creating multiple seams simultaneously is more complex. A method proposed by Avidan in 2007 involves iteratively removing each seam and storing an "index map" that records all the seams generated. This map can later be used for adjusting the size of the image.

While a full solution to the parallelization problem is challenging due to regeneration of energy and potential overlaps, a greedy approximation can be used. Starting from one end, the algorithm chooses the minimum energy path to the other end, marking used pixels to avoid duplication. Local seams for smaller parts of the image can also be computed in parallel for a good approximation.
